# HTML-CSS-Accessibility

## Description
After being given a website for a marketing agency called Horiseon, I was instructed to refactor the existing HTML/CSS code to meet a certain set of standards. The motivation behind this project is to have a website that is more optimized for search engines which proves good for business. This is achieved when the codebase follows basic accessibility standards which also solves any litigation that can potentially arise if users with disabilities are unable to access the site.

## Usage
The following objectives that were completed to fulfill search engine optimization and accessibility standards are as follows...
* Renamed all 'div' tags to it's appropriate corresponding semantic HTML element
* Added 'alt' attributes in the HTML code to images for page dictation in case a user has a visual disability
* Adjusted the heading attributes in the HTML code to ensure they fall in sequential order
* Created a concise, descreptive title for the webpage
* Ensured all links were responding as intended
* Used class selectors in the CSS code to group sections together to avoid redundancy
* Removed classes in the CSS Code that was unnecessary
